# Apple Watch AI Agent Development Checklist

## 1. Ideation & Planning
- [ ] Define the core purpose and user value of the AI agent
- [ ] Identify target user personas and use cases
- [ ] Research existing Apple Watch AI apps/agents for inspiration
- [ ] List key features and differentiators
- [ ] Draft initial user stories and scenarios
- [ ] Confirm technical feasibility (watchOS, SiriKit, CoreML, etc.)
- [ ] Identify required APIs (Gemini, Gemma, Google) and obtain API keys
- [ ] Plan secure storage and access for API keys (e.g., Keychain, environment variables)

## 2. Design
- [ ] Sketch user flows and main UI screens
- [ ] Design voice and/or touch interactions
- [ ] Plan notification and complication integration (if needed)
- [ ] Define data privacy and security requirements
- [ ] Create wireframes or prototypes
- [ ] Design secure API key handling and error messaging

## 3. Development Setup
- [ ] Set up Xcode project for watchOS
- [ ] Configure necessary entitlements (Siri, HealthKit, etc.)
- [ ] Integrate CoreML or other AI frameworks
- [ ] Set up version control (e.g., Git)
- [ ] Create or update `scripts_v1.js` to manage API key integration for Gemini, Gemma, and Google
    - [x] Note: `apiKey` is already defined in `scripts_v1.js`; no amendment needed at this stage
- [ ] Ensure API keys are not hardcoded and are securely referenced in code

## 4. Core Functionality Implementation
- [ ] Implement main AI logic (on-device or cloud-based)
- [ ] Build UI for main interactions
- [ ] Integrate with Apple Watch sensors/APIs as needed
- [ ] Handle voice input/output (if applicable)
- [ ] Implement notification/complication support
- [ ] Ensure accessibility compliance

## 5. Testing
- [ ] Write unit and UI tests
- [ ] Test on multiple Apple Watch models/sizes
- [ ] Validate AI accuracy and responsiveness
- [ ] Conduct usability testing with target users
- [ ] Address edge cases and error handling

## 6. Deployment
- [ ] Prepare App Store assets (icons, screenshots, description)
- [ ] Set up TestFlight for beta testing
- [ ] Collect and address beta feedback
- [ ] Finalize privacy policy and compliance checks
- [ ] Submit to App Store

## 7. Post-Launch & Iteration
- [ ] Monitor analytics and user feedback
- [ ] Fix bugs and optimize performance
- [ ] Plan and implement feature updates
- [ ] Maintain documentation and knowledge base
